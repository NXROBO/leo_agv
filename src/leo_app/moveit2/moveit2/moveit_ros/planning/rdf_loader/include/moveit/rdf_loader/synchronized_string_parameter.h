/**
 * @brief SynchronizedStringParameter is a way to load a string from the ROS environment.
 *
 * First it tries to load the string from a parameter.
 * If that fails, it subscribes to a std_msgs::String topic of the same name to get the value.
 *
 * If the parameter is loaded successfully, you can publish the value as a String msg if the publish_NAME param is true.
 *
 * You can specify how long to wait for a subscribed message with NAME_timeout (double in seconds)
 *
 * By default, the subscription will be killed after the first message is received.
 * If the parameter NAME_continuous is true, then the parent_callback will be called on every subsequent message.
