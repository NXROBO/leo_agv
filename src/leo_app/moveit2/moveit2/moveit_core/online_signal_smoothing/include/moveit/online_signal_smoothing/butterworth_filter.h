 * Class ButterworthFilter - Implementation of a signal filter to soften jerks.
 * This is a first-order Butterworth low-pass filter. First-order was chosen for 2 reasons:
 * - It doesn't overshoot
 * - Computational efficiency
 * This filter has been parameterized so there is only one parameter to tune.
 * See "Digital Implementation of Butterworth Firstâ€“Order Filter Type IIR" by
 * Horvath, Cervenanska, and Kotianova, 2019 and
 * Mienkina, M., Filter-Based Algorithm for Metering Applications,
 * https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/application-note/AN4265.pdf, 2016
 * It comes from finding the bilinear transform equivalent of the analog transfer function and
 * further applying the inverse z-transform.
 * The parameter "low_pass_filter_coeff" equals (2*pi / tan(omega_d * T))
 * where omega_d is the cutoff frequency and T is the samping period in sec.
